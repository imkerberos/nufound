This is a fork of the NuFound project, a revision of the libFoundation library.

ABOUT

This was forked from the original NuFound with the purpose of (1) reviving a dormant project and (2) then getting it up-to-date with the current state of FoundationKit.

LICENSE

NuFound is released under the Apache Public License, v. 2.0.
libFoundation is available under a more liberal original license.

INSTALLATION

As a stop-gap measure, modify config.h.
make -f Makefile.cygwin
You may then wish to copy the headers from ./Foundation.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The original contributors to NuFound are jsyedidia, Markus Hardt, and timburks. They have done a significant job of getting the original libFoundation up-to-date.

Many (many many!) thanks to  Mircea Oancea, Ovidiu Predescu, and Helge Hess
for sharing their work on libFoundation.
