I'm slowly updating all the classes available to fit their SDK 10.6 equivalents. I won't add any (or too many?) new classes just yet - hopefully I won't break anything. So far I've done:

* NSAutoreleasePool
  Added -drain.
* NSValue
  Added +valueWithRange
  Added -rangeValue.
* NSInteger and NSUInteger
  Defined in NSObject.h.
* NSNumber
  Added +numberWith.., -initWith.., and -..Value methods for NSInteger and NSUInteger.
* NSError
  The class seemed to be stubbed out - I implemented it.
* NSTask
  Added -processIdentifier.
  Added -terminationReason.
* NSException
  Added -callStackReturnAddresses
  Added -callStackSymbols
  Note, though - both seem to be clearly intended for backtrace_symbols(), so on __WIN32__ no-ops.
* NSTimer
  Added -setFireDate (odd that fireDate already seems to be there...)
  Added -initWithFireDate:interval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: (with setFireDate, of course.)
* NSHost
  Added -localizedName w/o KVO.
