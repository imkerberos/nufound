I'm slowly updating all the classes available to fit their SDK 10.6 equivalents. I won't add any (or too many?) new classes just yet - hopefully I won't break anything. So far I've done:

* NSAutoreleasePool
  Added -drain.
* NSValue
  Added +valueWithRange
  Added -rangeValue.
* NSInteger and NSUInteger
  Defined in NSObject.h.
* NSNumber
  Added +numberWith.., -initWith.., and -..Value methods for NSInteger and NSUInteger.
