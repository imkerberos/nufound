I'm slowly updating all the classes available to fit their SDK 10.6 equivalents. I won't add any (or too many?) new classes just yet - hopefully I won't break anything. So far I've done:

* NSAutoreleasePool
  Added -drain.
* NSValue
  Added +valueWithRange
  Added -rangeValue.
* NSInteger and NSUInteger
  Defined in NSObject.h.
* NSNumber
  Added +numberWith.., -initWith.., and -..Value methods for NSInteger and NSUInteger.
* NSError
  The class seemed to be stubbed out - I implemented it.
* NSTask
  Added -processIdentifier.
  Added -terminationReason.
* NSException
  Added -callStackReturnAddresses
  Added -callStackSymbols
  Note, though - both seem to be clearly intended for backtrace_symbols(), so on __WIN32__ no-ops.
  Implemented NSCoding and NSCopying.
* NSTimer
  Added -setFireDate (odd that fireDate already seems to be there...)
  Added -initWithFireDate:interval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: (with setFireDate, of course.)
* NSHost
  Added -localizedName w/o KVO.
* NSNotificationCenter
  Checked off - we don't have blocks yet, so no -addObserver...block.
* NSNotification
  Added NSCopying to the list of protocols supported - apparently it's already been implemented but never exposed.
* NSInvocation
  Checks out.
* NSObject protocol
  Checks out.
* NSCoding protocol
  Checks out.
* NSCopying protocol
  Checks out.
* NSProxy
  Added (that is to say, stubs out) -finalize;.
* NSMutableCopying
  Checks out.
* NSData
  Added NSDataWritingOptions
  Added NSDataReadingOptions (these are disregarded, though.)
  Added +dataWithBytesNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone
  Added -[init/data]WithContentsOfURL:option:error: (this works well with -path)
  Added -writeToFile:options:error: (this as well, mind you)
  Added -writeToURL:atomically:/options:error: - this is just a frontend to writeToFile since OSX only supports file:// URLS anyway.
* NSDate
  Added -descriptionWithCalendarFormat:timeZone:locale: to header file.
  Added -dateByAddingTimeInterval: (this just feeds into addTimeInterval.)
